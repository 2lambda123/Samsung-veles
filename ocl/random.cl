@brief Generates equidistributed random numbers.
@param states Array of the random generators states.
@param output Equidistributed random numbers, result is written as follows:
              random1(state1)..randomN(state1)
              random1(stateK)..randomN(stateK).
@param rounds Number of rounds for generation,
              each round generates 128 bytes for each random state.
@details global_size is the number of states, and algorithm is described in Wikipedia:

The following generator has 1024 bits of state, a maximal period of 2^1024 âˆ’ 1, passes BigCrush,
emit a sequence of 64-bit values that is equidistributed in the maximum possible dimension.

This is xorshift1024* from http://xorshift.di.unimi.it.

   This is the fastest generator passing BigCrush without systematic
   errors, but due to the relatively short period it is acceptable only
   for applications with a very mild amount of parallelism; otherwise, use
   a xorshift1024* generator.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to pass it twice through MurmurHash3's
   avalanching function.

uint64_t s[ 2 ];

uint64_t next(void) {
  uint64_t s1 = s[ 0 ];
  const uint64_t s0 = s[ 1 ];
  s[ 0 ] = s0;
  s1 ^= s1 << 23; // a
  return ( s[ 1 ] = ( s1 ^ s0 ^ ( s1 >> 17 ) ^ ( s0 >> 26 ) ) ) + s0; // b, c
}
